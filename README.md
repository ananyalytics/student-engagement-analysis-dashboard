Power BI dashboard analysing student engagement and retention trends.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of student engagement patterns in an EdTech platform using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes key metrics including user distribution, retention rates, satisfaction scores, and churn patterns across different subscription tiers (Free, Basic, Premium) from 2021-2024.

## 🎯 Key Insights

- **Average Time Spent**: 40.80 hours per student
- **Satisfaction Score**: 6.67/10 average across all users
- **Total Engagement**: 20K cumulative hours
- **Active Users**: 65.4% retention rate
- **Churn Rate**: 34.6% of users discontinued

### Subscription Tier Analysis

- **Free Users**: Highest satisfaction score (7.3/10) despite being non-paying customers
- **Basic Users**: Best retention with 348 days average, representing 33.2% of user base
- **Premium Users**: Lower satisfaction (6.1/10) but represents 28.6% of users with 311 retention days

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop**: Dashboard creation and data visualization
- **DAX**: Calculated measures and metrics
- **Power Query**: Data transformation and cleaning

## 📈 Dashboard Components

1. **Sub Type Distribution**: Donut chart showing user distribution across Free, Basic, and Premium tiers
2. **Retention Days by Sub Type**: Bar chart comparing retention rates across subscription types
3. **Churn Flag**: Pie chart visualizing active vs churned users
4. **Satisfaction Score by Sub Type**: Comparative analysis of satisfaction across tiers
5. **Satisfaction vs Time Spent**: Scatter plot revealing correlation patterns between engagement and satisfaction

## 🔍 Key Findings

**The Satisfaction Paradox**: Free users demonstrate higher satisfaction scores compared to paid tiers, suggesting potential areas for improvement in Premium offerings.

**Retention Insights**: Basic subscribers show the strongest retention (348 days), indicating this tier may offer the optimal value proposition.

**Engagement Patterns**: A weak positive correlation exists between time spent and satisfaction, with most users clustering in the 20-60 hour range with 7-9 satisfaction scores.
